  abstract = {Early stress detection in crop plants is highly relevant, but hard to achieve. We hypothesize that close range hyperspectral imaging is able to uncover stress related processes non-destructively in the early stages which are invisible to the human eye. We propose an approach which combines unsupervised and supervised methods in order to identify several stages of progressive stress development from series of hyperspectral images. Stress of an entire plant is detected by stress response levels at pixel scale. The focus is on drought stress in barley (Hordeum vulgare). Unsupervised learning is used to separate hyperspectral signatures into clusters related to different stages of stress response and progressive senescence. Whereas all such signatures may be found in both, well watered and drought stressed plants, their respective distributions differ. Ordinal classification with Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used to quantify and visualize the distribution of progressive stages of senescence and to separate well watered from drought stressed plants. For each senescence stage a distinctive set of most relevant Vegetation Indices (VIs) is identified. The method has been applied on two experiments involving potted barley plants under well watered and drought stress conditions in a greenhouse. Drought stress is detected up to ten days earlier than using NDVI. Furthermore, it is shown that some VIs have overall relevance, while others are specific to particular senescence stages. The transferability of the method to the field is illustrated by an experiment on maize (Zea mays).},

  abstract = {Ornamental production systems are complicated to manage due to the many species and genera that may be grown and handled together on a single production site. Ornamentals are threatened by various phytopathogenic fungi in greenhouse and field production. Among these, Botrytis cinerea is one of the most notorious pathogens of ornamentals, specifically cut flowers. B. cinerea is responsible for causing Botrytis blight disease in both pre- and post-harvest conditions. The pathogen infects leaves, stems, flowers, etc., and causes petal specking, flower blight, sepal yellowing, and peduncle bending, among other symptoms. The ability of B. cinerea to cause disease in greenhouses and fields, as well as in subsequent handling, storage, and transportation, makes this fungus an important pathogen due to its potential negative economic effects on the cut flower industry. For the management of B. cinerea, the routine application of fungicides is considered a major tool in commercial production. However, fungicide resistance, phytotoxicity, application residues, environmental concerns, and health issues have forced growers to seek alternative management approaches. In this review paper, we discuss the different approaches (classic to novel strategies) used for B. cinerea management, including chemical methods and their modes of action. The integration of new practices with existing management strategies (sanitation, nutrition, plant regulators, botanical extracts, biological control, fungicides) could provide effective results in ornamental production systems. Understanding the ecology of pathosystems, disease epidemiology and the integration of all possible management measures as a system approach may also provide adequate disease suppression in both pre- and post-harvest conditions.},

Existing equipment and analysis algorithms are adapted to highly controlled environmental conditions in the laboratory. However, only real time information from the field scale is able to guide plant protection measures and to optimize the use of resources. At the field scale, many parameters such as the optimal measurement distance, informative feature sets, and suitable algorithms have not been investigated. In this study, the hyperspectral detection and quantification of yellow rust in wheat was evaluated using two measurement platforms: a ground-based vehicle and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Different disease development stages and disease severities were provided in a plot-based field experiment. Measurements were performed weekly during the vegetation period. Data analysis was performed by three prediction algorithms with a focus on the selection of optimal feature sets. In this context, the across-scale application of optimized feature sets, an approach of information transfer between scales, was also evaluated. Relevant aspects for an on-line disease assessment in the field integrating affordable sensor technology, sensor spatial resolution, compact analysis models, and fast evaluation have been outlined and reflected upon. For the first time, a hyperspectral imaging observation experiment of a plant disease was comparatively performed at two scales, ground canopy and UAV.},

The proposed flexible design is a generic framework that uses Growing Degree Days to determine annual variable start and end dates for the insured period. This approach reflects the progress of phenological plant growth phases more accurately than fixed periods and hence is expected to reduce the basis risk of the index insurance. In addition, we develop an economic framework that focuses on the role of downside risks and apply Quantile Regression to tailor optimal insurance specifications. This framework is then used to compare the downside risks associated with the use of flexible and fixed insurance periods. The results show that the introduction of flexibility in the index design leads to a reduction in farmers’ downside risk exposure and to a more efficient contract design.},

  abstract = {Agroforestry interventions have the potential to benefit the livelihoods of farmers and communities worldwide. However, given the high system complexity, the long-term benefits of agroforestry are difficult to anticipate. This study aimed to integrate uncertainty into long-term performance projections for agroforestry interventions in the highlands of Northwest Vietnam. We applied decision analysis and probabilistic modeling approaches to produce economic ex-ante assessments for seven agroforestry options (intercropping of maize, forage grass, or coffee with tea, nut, fruit, and timber trees) promoted in the region. Our results indicate that farmers likely prefer annual monocultures due to the relatively early incomes and short time-lag on returns. However, the results also show that annual profits from monocrops can be expected to decrease over time, due mainly to unsustainable soil use. Agroforestry systems, on the other hand, return substantial profits in the long term, but they also incur high establishment and maintenance costs and can generate net losses in the first few years. Initial financial incentives to compensate for these losses may help in promoting agroforestry adoption in the region. Uncertainties related to farmers’ time preference, crop yields, and crop prices appeared to have the greatest influence on whether monocropping or agroforestry emerged as the preferable option. Narrowing these key knowledge gaps may offer additional clarity on farmers’ optimal course of action and provide guidance for agencies promoting agroforestry interventions in Vietnam and elsewhere. Our model produced a set of plausible ranges for net present values and highlighted critical variables, more clarity on which would support decision-making under uncertainty. Our innovative research approach proved effective in providing forecasts of uncertain outcomes and can be useful for informing similar development interventions in other contexts.},

We find that because irrigation reduces the negative skewness of profit margin distributions, i.e. downside risk, farmers have an additional incentive to use irrigation more intensively. Not considering downside risks may thus imply an underestimation of agricultural water use.},

In this study, we demonstrate the characterization of temporal dynamics of plant growth and water use, and leaf water content of two maize genotypes under two different water treatments. RGB (Red Green Blue) images are processed to estimate projected plant area, which are correlated with destructively measured plant shoot fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW) and leaf area. Estimated plant FW and DW, along with pot weights, are used to derive daily plant water consumption and water use efficiency (WUE) of the individual plants. Hyperspectral images of plants are processed to extract plant leaf reflectance and correlate with leaf water content (LWC). Strong correlations are found between projected plant area and all three destructively measured plant parameters (R2 {$>$} 0.95) at early growth stages. The correlations become weaker at later growth stages due to the large difference in plant structure between the two maize genotypes. Daily water consumption (or evapotranspiration) is largely determined by water treatment, whereas WUE (or biomass accumulation per unit of water used) is clearly determined by genotype, indicating a strong genetic control of WUE. LWC is successfully predicted with the hyperspectral images for both genotypes (R2 = 0.81 and 0.92). Hyperspectral imaging can be a very powerful tool to phenotype biochemical traits of the whole maize plants, complementing RGB for plant morphological trait analysis.},

  abstract = {Background: The detection and characterization of resistance reactions of crop plants against fungal pathogens are essential to select resistant genotypes. In breeding practice phenotyping of plant genotypes is realized by time consuming and expensive visual rating. In this context hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a promising non-invasive sensor technique in order to accelerate and to automate classical phenotyping methods. A hyperspectral microscope was established to determine spectral changes on the leaf and cellular level of barley (Hordeum vulgare) during resistance reactions against powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei, isolate K1). Experiments were conducted with near isogenic barley lines of cv. Ingrid, including the susceptible wild type (WT), mildew locus a 12 (Mla12 based resistance) and the resistant mildew locus o 3 (mlo3 based resistance), respectively. The reflection of inoculated and non-inoculated leaves was recorded daily with a hyperspectral linescanner in the visual (400 – 700 nm) and near infrared (700 – 1000 nm) range 3 to 14 days after inoculation. Results: Data analysis showed no significant differences in spectral signatures between non-inoculated genotypes. Barley leaves of the near-isogenic genotypes, inoculated with B. graminis f.sp. hordei differed in the spectral reflectance over time, respectively. The susceptible genotypes (WT, Mla12) showed an increase in reflectance in the visible range according to symptom development. However, the spectral signature of the resistant mlo-genotype did not show significant changes over the experimental period. In addition, a recent data driven approach for automated discovery of disease specific signatures, which is based on a new representation of the data using Simplex Volume Maximization (SiVM) was applied. The automated approach - evaluated in only a fraction of time revealed results similar to the time and labor intensive manually assessed hyperspectral signatures. The new representation determined by SiVM was also used to generate intuitive and easy to interpretable summaries, e.g. fingerprints or traces of hyperspectral dynamics of the different genotypes. Conclusion: With this HSI based and data driven phenotyping approach an evaluation of host-pathogen interactions over time and a discrimination of barley genotypes differing in susceptibility to powdery mildew is possible.},

  abstract = {Climate change will alter the environmental conditions for crop growth and require adjustments in management practices at the field scale. In this paper, we analyzed the impacts of two different climate change scenarios on optimal field management practices in winterwheat and grain maize production with case studies from Switzerland. Management options included nitrogen fertilization (amount, timing and allocation) as well as irrigation. Optimal solutions that maximize the farmer’s utility were sought with the help of a bioeconomic modeling system that integrated the process-based crop growth model CropSyst into an economic decision model. The latter accounted not only for the crop specific average profit margins, but also for production risks, reflecting the utility (expressed as the certainty equivalent) of a risk-averse farmer’s management decisions at field scale. In view of the non-linearity and complexity of the problem, we used a genetic algorithm as optimization technique. For grain maize, our results showed that climate change will foster the use of irrigation, not only at sites prone to water limitation already under current climatic conditions, but more in general for climate change scenarios projecting a substantial decrease in summer precipitation. For winterwheat, irrigation was never identified as an optimal management option. For both crops and sites, climate change reduced the optimum nitrogen fertilization amount and decreased for winterwheat the number of fertilization applications. In all cases, the farmer’s certainty equivalent decreased between 7\% and 25\% under climate change, implying negative impacts on winterwheat and grain maize production even under the assumption of an adjustment of the optimum management practices.},

  abstract = {Decision-making in development rarely considers uncertainty in project benefits and costs and the risk of project failure. Lack of appropriate tools for ex-ante analysis under conditions of data scarcity constrains the ability of decision-makers to anticipate project outcomes. Business analysis techniques can help in such situations, but they have rarely been applied in development contexts. We use the principles of Applied Information Economics to develop a decision model for a water supply intervention. In the proposed Habaswein-Wajir Water Supply Project in Northern Kenya, water is to be extracted from a major aquifer near Habaswein and piped to the city of Wajir. A team of eight experts developed a model including all costs, benefits, and risks considered important for project success. After estimation training, these experts expressed their uncertainty for about 100 variables in the model with probability distributions. We used Monte Carlo simulation to project decision outcomes, and Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to identify critical uncertainties affecting the decision. The project was found to be risky for most stakeholders, mainly due to the risk of political interference caused by water supply concerns in Habaswein and due to unclear profitability of the water supply business. Uncertainties about how to value decreasing infant mortality and reduction in water-borne disease incidence were also critical. The greatest hydrological risk was salt water intrusion into the aquifer. Careful well design, inclusive project planning and benefit sharing could raise the chance of project success. The analysis improved understanding of the decision by all stakeholders, some of which changed their opinions on the pipeline, requested more measurements, or proposed alternative water supply options. Decision analysis can help clarify decision uncertainties and outcome expectations and thereby improve decision-making processes, especially in data-scarce areas.},

  abstract = {Assessment evaluates accumulated knowledge and its limits. It informs and ideally empowers decisions and actions on complex, contested issues with persistent uncertainties. Applying rigorous expert judgment is an important dimension of assessment. Here we evaluate advances and challenges in approaches to expert judgment in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5). We find that revised guidance for author teams improved the development of balanced judgments on scientific evidence across disciplines. In particular, expert judgments underpinning conclusions are more extensively, transparently, and consistently communicated: degree-of-certainty terms are more abundant in AR5 policymaker summaries; wider ranges of possible outcomes are presented with greater inclusion of lower-certainty, decision-relevant findings; and expert judgments supporting conclusions are more comparable across working groups. But challenges in developing and communicating assessment conclusions persist, especially for findings with substantial uncertainties and for subjective aspects of judgments. Based on our evaluations and AR5 lessons learned, we propose a simpler, more rigorous framework for developing and communicating expert judgments in environmental assessment. We also describe practices for reducing expert-judgment biases, for advancing integration of evidence and expert judgment, and for addressing subjective dimensions of expert opinion directly and proactively.},

  abstract = {Background: The use of hyperspectral cameras is well established in the field of plant phenotyping, especially as a part of high-throughput routines in greenhouses. Nevertheless, the workflows used differ depending on the applied camera, the plants being imaged, the experience of the users, and the measurement set-up. Results: This review describes a general workflow for the assessment and processing of hyperspectral plant data at greenhouse and laboratory scale. Aiming at a detailed description of possible error sources, a comprehensive literature review of possibilities to overcome these errors and influences is provided. The processing of hyperspectral data of plants starting from the hardware sensor calibration, the software processing steps to overcome sensor inaccuracies, and the preparation for machine learning is shown and described in detail. Furthermore, plant traits extracted from spectral hypercubes are categorized to standardize the terms used when describing hyperspectral traits in plant phenotyping. A scientific data perspective is introduced covering information for canopy, single organs, plant development, and also combined traits coming from spectral and 3D measuring devices. Conclusions: This publication provides a structured overview on implementing hyperspectral imaging into biological studies at greenhouse and laboratory scale. Workflows have been categorized to define a trait-level scale according to their metrological level and the processing complexity. A general workflow is shown to outline procedures and requirements to provide fully calibrated data of the highest quality. This is essential for differentiation of the smallest changes from hyperspectral reflectance of plants, to track and trace hyperspectral development as an answer to biotic or abiotic stresses.},

  abstract = {Available options for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events on temperate fruit trees involve a number of risks and uncertainties, leaving growers hesitant about the benefits of implementing new technologies to protect their orchards. We used Decision Analysis approaches, which account for these risks and uncertainties, to assess investment decisions in sweet cherry production systems in central Chile. We evaluated the adoption of polyethylene covers for orchards in northern- and southern-central Chile. Gathering expert and key stakeholder knowledge, we identified relevant variables for the adoption decision and developed a causal impact pathway model. We parameterized this model by collecting estimates from experts in the form of probability distributions. We implemented the model as a Monte Carlo simulation and projected probability distributions for the Net Present Value and the annual cash flow. Results highlight that farmers in southern-central Chile could expect major benefits from covering their orchards, with a 90\% confidence interval for the Net Present Value from − 33,605 USD to 595,447 USD. In northern-central areas, implementing covers did not significantly improve the Net Present Value (90\% confidence interval from − 149,597 USD to 433,361 USD). Across zones, our model results were sensitive to market price, crop yield, and fruit quality problems (i.e. low firmness). Cover effec­ tiveness against rain events was relevant only in the southern-central zone, whereas effectiveness against frost events was relevant in both sites. Expected Value of Perfect Information calculations revealed that additional information on yield and market price could substantially help to make a confident decision. Our simulations suggest that orchard protection in southern-central Chile may be necessary for secure and profitable cherry production in the future. In this case study, we demonstrated the applicability of Decision Analysis to support farmers in identifying appropriate and effective strategies in time to overcome future challenges resulting from climate change.},

  abstract = {Agricultural management decisions are usually made without perfect knowledge. Decision Analysis (DA) approaches translate available uncertain information on costs, benefits and risks involved in decisions into actionable management recommendations. We illustrate the use of DA procedures to inform decisions on disease management strategies in ornamental plant production. We worked with heather growers and other stakeholders in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, to model the impacts of changing disease management practices and to generate comprehensive forecasts of net returns. Through sensitivity analysis and Value of Information assessment we identified critical uncertainties regarding the feasibility of improved practices. Partial Farm Budgets for decision options ranged from a loss of more than 200,000 V to a gain of nearly 70,000 V per hectare and year. Findings suggest that reducing pesticide applications without additional monitoring may substantially increase production risks (chance of loss of 76\%) and that intensified plant monitoring is likely to increase net benefits (chance of gain of 68\%) by allowing earlier detection and more focused fungicide application. Our Decision Analysis approach facilitated ex-ante evaluation of innovative management strategies in heather production, and it holds promise for similar evaluations in other agricultural production systems.},

  abstract = {Grasslands cover a major share of the world’s agricultural area and are important for global food security. Plant species diversity in grasslands is known to increase and stabilize biomass yields. We economically evaluate these effects, using a rich dataset from 16 intensively managed grassland sites across Europe. We extend earlier research by accounting for plant species diversity effects on both quantity and quality of yields. Consequently, we can express plant species diversity effects in terms of milk production potential yields per hectare and potential revenues thereof. Plant species diversity not only increased milk production potential yields and thus revenues, but also reduced production risks. Thus, increasing plant species diversity resulted in higher certainty equivalents, for example, the certainty equivalent rose by +29\% when comparing the average mixture to the average monoculture. For risk averse decision makers, this gain in certainty equivalent was mainly due to the increase in revenues (accounting for 90\%) compared to the total insurance value (accounting for 10\%). Overall, we show that farmers benefit economically from plant species diversity and that even a moderate increase in this diversity contributes to more stable grassland-based production. Thus, our results are highly relevant for future sustainable intensification of grassland-based production.},

  abstract = {Decision-support systems (DSSs) are interactive computer-based systems that help decision makers solve unstructured problems under complex, uncertain conditions. Experimental use of DSSs has resulted in improved disease suppression and lowered risks of crop damage. In many cases, it has also led to the use of smaller quantities of active substances, as compared with standard spraying practices. Hundreds of DSSs have been developed over the years and are readily available and affordable. However, most farm managers do not use them as part of their integrated pest management (IPM) practices. Since the mid-1980s, the author of this paper, together with numerous colleagues, has developed DSSs and decision rules for the management of diseases in a variety of crops, including extensive crops, such as wheat, sunflower, and pea; semi-intensive crops, such as pear, chickpea, cotton, and tarragon; and intensive crops, such as tomato, potato, cucumber, sweet pepper, carrot, and grapevine. Some of these systems were used widely, but others were not. This experience may allow us to draw general conclusions regarding the use of DSSs and decision rules. Possible explanations for the widely varying acceptance rates are presented, and the effects of anticipated changes in the agribusiness sector on the future use of DSSs are discussed.},

  abstract = {Forest and Landscape Restoration (FLR) is carried out with the objective of regaining ecological functions and enhancing human well-being through intervention in degrading ecosystems. However, uncertainties and risks related to FLR make it difficult to predict long-term outcomes and inform investment plans. We applied a Sto­ chastic Impact Evaluation framework (SIE) to simulate returns on investment in the case of FLR interventions in a degraded dry Afromontane forest while accounting for uncertainties. We ran 10,000 iterations of a Monte Carlo simulation that projected FLR outcomes over a period of 25 years. Our simulations show that investments in assisted natural regeneration, enrichment planting, exclosure establishment and soil-water conservation struc­ tures all have a greater than 77\% chance of positive returns. Sensitivity analysis of these outcomes indicated that the greatest threat to positive cashflows is the time required to achieve the targeted ecological outcomes. Value of Information (VOI) analysis indicated that the biggest priority for further measurement in this case is the maturity age of exclosures at which maximum biomass accumulation is achieved. The SIE framework was effective in providing forecasts of the distribution of outcomes and highlighting critical uncertainties where further measurements can help support decision-making. This approach can be useful for informing the man­ agement and planning of similar FLR interventions.},

  abstract = {Many decisions are based on beliefs concerning the likelihood of uncertain events such as the outcome of an election, the guilt of a defendant, or the future value of the dollar. These beliefs are usually expressed in statements such as "I think that . . . ," "chances are . . . ," "it is unlikely that . . . ," and so forth. Occasionally, beliefs concerning uncertain events are expressed in numerical form as odds or subjective probabilities. What determines such beliefs? How do people assess the probability of an uncertain event or the value of an uncertain quantity? This article shows that people rely on a limited number of heuristic principles which reduce the complex tasks of assessing probabilities and predicting values to simpler judgmental operations. In general, these heuristics are quite useful, but sometimes they lead to severe and systematic errors. The subjective assessment of probability resembles the subjective assessment of physical quantities such as distance or size. These judgments are all based on data of limited validity, which are processed according to heuristic rules. For example, the apparent distance of an object is determined in part by its clarity. The more sharply the object is seen, the closer it appears to be. This rule has some validity, -because in any given scene the more distant objects are seen less sharply than nearer objects. However, the reliance on this rule leads to systematic errors in the estimation of distance. Specifically, distances are often overestimated when visibility is poor because the contours of objects are blurred. On the other hand, distances are often underesti- The authors are members of the department of psychology at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel. mated when visibility is good because the objects are seen sharply. Thus, the reliance on clarity as an indication of distance leads to common biases. Such biases are also found in the intuitive judgment of probability. This article describes three heuristics that are employed to assess probabilities and to predict values. Biases to which these heuristics lead are enumerated, and the applied and theoretical implications of these observations are discussed.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Many conservation initiatives for managing social-ecological landscapes factor in the best available biophysical information. However, insufficient consideration of social aspects can render such initiatives ineffective. By incorporating stakeholders' perceptions and values, and by involving stakeholders (transparently) in decision-making processes, conservation plans and efforts can better achieve desired goals and targets. Results: In this paper, we present and analyze three case studies within different ecological and land use contexts. Each case study uses different participatory approaches to elicit stakeholders' perceptions and values, while seeking to involve stakeholders in the decision-making process. The case studies are the following: (1) participatory scenario planning for a protected area in Doñana coastal wetland in Southwestern Spain; (2) assessment of ecosystem services trade-offs and social responses on rewards for agro-biodiversity in the rubber agroforest landscape in Jambi, Indonesia; and (3) socio-cultural evaluation, through visual stimuli, of ecosystem services provided by transhumance cultural landscapes in Central Spain. We discuss how stakeholders perceive and value their environments and to what extent participatory approaches are useful for capturing information relating to land use and ecological processes. Conclusions: Social-ecological systems are inherently complex, having a variety of interacting actors with different types of ecological knowledge, interests, and values. Different participatory tools or approaches are appropriate for various and specific contexts and objectives. Determining and integrating the various types of knowledge and values of different actors can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of social-ecological systems.},

  abstract = {It is often very difficult to make accurate projections about how interventions will affect the real world and to use such projections to develop effective implementation plans, monitor progress and evaluate project impacts. This is due to a variety of factors including lack of data, complex impact pathways and risks and uncertainties that are difficult to factor into intervention planning. Scientific approaches to produce reliable impact projections are rarely applied in agricultural development, but Decision Analysis techniques commonly used in other fields have the potential to improve development decisions. This working paper outlines a Decision Analysis approach that can help decision makers efficiently allocate resources to enhance the effectiveness of policy decisions. The procedures outlined in this publication feature the construction of causal models – models that describe the mechanisms through which intervention impacts will be delivered – that are codeveloped by experts, stakeholders and analysts through facilitated participatory processes. These models are then formalized as Bayesian Network (BN) models, a modelling approach that has been widely applied in a range of disciplines, including medical sciences, genetics, environmental sciences and legal reasoning. BNs allow for the formal representation of causal models, such as intervention impact pathways. They can work effectively with incomplete information, combine expert knowledge with other sources of information and allow for adequate consideration of risk. This paper illustrates the use of participatory workshops that convene experts on the systems, stakeholders involved in ongoing or prospective projects and analysts. These teams can jointly develop impact pathways for the interventions, which can be formalized into quantitative BN models. After several rounds of feedback elicitation and the inclusion of data from experts and other sources, stochastic simulations can be run to determine the likely impacts of the interventions. Results can be presented back to stakeholders for feedback. Through the tools presented in this working paper, critical uncertainties in the models of intervention impact pathways can be identified. These high-value variables can determine uncertainty about project outcomes. Further measurement or disaggregation of these variables can support decisionmaking processes. By demonstrating improved intervention decisions with little additional investment and improved tools for intervention decision modelling, we hope that this approach will be widely adopted and used to enhance the efficacy of development activities.},

  abstract = {The establishment of protected areas, such as Natura 2000, is a common approach to curbing biodiversity loss. But many of these areas are owned or managed by private actors. Policies indicate that their involvement should be encouraged to ensure long term success. However, to date there have been no systematic evaluations of whether local actor involvement in the management of protected areas does in fact contribute to the conservation of biodiversity, which is the expressed policy goal. Research incorporating both qualitative and quantitative data was carried out in three case studies in Scotland where local actor input was required in the development and/or implementation of Natura 2000 management plans. No relationship was found between the characteristics of the process of stakeholder involvement and stakeholders’ perceptions of future biodiversity outcomes. Social outcomes of increased stakeholder involvement, such as increased trust, did however increase the perceived likelihood of positive future biodiversity outcomes. The findings indicate that efforts aimed at increasing stakeholder involvement in the management of protected areas need to consider making processes more independent, and acknowledge and address underlying biodiversity conflicts. The findings also emphasise the need to evaluate multi-level conservation efforts in terms of processes, social outcomes and biodiversity outcomes.},

  abstract = {Plant stresses have been monitored using the imaging or spectrometry of plant leaves in the visible (red-green-blue or RGB), near-infrared (NIR), infrared (IR), and ultraviolet (UV) wavebands, often augmented by fluorescence imaging or fluorescence spectrometry. Imaging at multiple specific wavelengths (multi-spectral imaging) or across a wide range of wavelengths (hyperspectral imaging) can provide exceptional information on plant stress and subsequent diseases. Digital cameras, thermal cameras, and optical filters have become available at a low cost in recent years, while hyperspectral cameras have become increasingly more compact and portable. Furthermore, smartphone cameras have dramatically improved in quality, making them a viable option for rapid, on-site stress detection. Due to these developments in imaging technology, plant stresses can be monitored more easily using handheld and field-deployable methods. Recent advances in machine learning algorithms have allowed for images and spectra to be analyzed and classified in a fully automated and reproducible manner, without the need for complicated image or spectrum analysis methods. This review will highlight recent advances in portable (including smartphone-based) detection methods for biotic and abiotic stresses, discuss data processing and machine learning techniques that can produce results for stress identification and classification, and suggest future directions towards the successful translation of these methods into practical use.},
